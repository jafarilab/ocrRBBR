* This is a new release.

1) Installed package size is 24.6 MB.
   The majority of the size (24.4 MB) comes from example multiome ATAC-seq and RNA-seq datasets
   included in the `data/` directory. These datasets are essential to demonstrate and test
   the package functionality and are provided in compressed format.

2) Some examples exceed the recommended execution time.
   These examples are intentionally computational to demonstrate realistic use cases of the
   methods on biological data. They complete in a reasonable time on standard hardware and
   do not require excessive memory.
